# Advent of Code 2024

I'm primarily doing this challenge in `python` but may branch out to other
languages if I have time. I honestly feel like I'm terrible at coding challenges
and problems, so I need to practice in case I get laid off xdd.

## Development

Use `devenv` and `direnv` to setup the developer shell with dependencies and
tooling included!

Alternatively, use VSCode and the `devcontainer.json` to build a development
container.
